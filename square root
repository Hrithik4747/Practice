Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.


class Solution {
  public:
    int countSquares(int N) {
        // code here
        
        float ans = 0;
        ans = sqrt(N);
        
        int count = 0;
        
        for( int i = 1; i< ans; i++){
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
